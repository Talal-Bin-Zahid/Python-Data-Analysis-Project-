# Tips for Data Analyst Report

This repository contains a collection of tips and best practices for creating effective data  analyst reports . Whether you're a begineer or an experienced analyst , these tips will help you communicate ypur findings clearly and effectively .

## Installation by creating a python virtual environment  

```bash
# create a new environment 
python -m venv .venv 

# Activate the virtual environment in windows using gitbash
source .venv/Scripts/activate

# Create a requirements.txt file and add libraries inside
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
# Required libraries
pip install pandas 
pip install numpy 
pip install matplotlib
pip install plotly 
pip install seaborn
from scipy import stats
from IPython.display import display
```

## 2. Create a Jupyter Notebook  

```bash  
# create a ipynb file 
mkdir scripts 
cd scripts 
touch data_analysis.ipynb 
```

### 2.1. Use of github copilot for data analytics report  

Here is the prompt no. 1 :

> Act as a data analyst , and write the code using python libraries oandas , numpy , seaborn , plotly , matplotlib to do the basic data analyst tasks such as :

1. Data Composition Report
2. Data Distribution Report
3. Data Comparison Report
4. Data Relationship report

> If you need to do statistics you can also use the preinstalled libraries such as scipy and statsmodels.
> If you want to create a plot and whenever you do that , please interpret the results as I would like to submit that in a report form .

## Diamonds Data Analysis Report

Prepared by : Talal Bin Zahid
Date : 29 October 2025
Dataset : Diamonds Dataset

## Executive Summary

This analysis explores the characteristics and relationships within the diamonds dataset, focusing on key attributes that influence diamond pricing and quality assessment.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about diamonds with the following characteristics:

- carat: Weight of the diamond
- cut: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- color: Diamond color, from J (worst) to D (best)
- clarity: Measurement of diamond clarity
- depth: Total depth percentage
- table: Width of top relative to widest point
- price: Price in USD
- x, y, z: Length, width, depth in mm

## 1. Data Composition Analysis

### Dataset Structure

### Key Findings

- Total Records: 53,940 diamonds
- Features: 10 characteristics analyzed
- Data Types: 3 categorical (cut, color, clarity) and 7 numerical variables
- Missing Values: None detected - dataset is complete

## 2. Distribution Analysis

### Numerical Variables

- Price Distribution Analysis
- Skewness: 1.62 (right-skewed)
- Kurtosis: 2.73 (leptokurtic)
- Carat Weight Analysis
- Central Tendency: 0.797 carats average
- Range: 0.2 to 5.01 carats

### Categorical Variables

- Cut Quality Distribution
- Most Common: Ideal cut (40% of samples)
- Distribution Pattern: Right-skewed towards higher quality cuts

## 3. Comparative Analysis

### Price by Cut Quality

- ANOVA Results: F-stat = 324.56, p-value < 0.001
- Interpretation: Significant price variation across cut qualities

### Price by Clarity

- Relationship Analysis
- Key Differences: Higher clarity grades command premium prices

## 4. Relationship Analysis

### Correlation Matrix

### Key Relationships

1. Price vs Carat:
   - Correlation: 0.92 (very strong positive)
   - R-squared: 0.85 (85% of price variance explained by carat)

2. Depth vs Width:
   - Correlation: 0.65
   - Linear Relationship: Moderate positive correlation

## Conclusions

1. Primary Price Drivers:
   - Carat weight shows strongest correlation (0.92)
   - Cut quality significantly impacts value (p < 0.001)

2. Quality Distributions:
   - Most diamonds are of Ideal quality (40%)
   - Color grades show progressive decrease from J to D

## Recommendations

1. For Buyers:
   - Focus on carat weight and cut quality for best value
   - Consider trade-offs between size and clarity

2. For Market Analysis:
   - Monitor price-per-carat trends
   - Track cut quality distribution changes in market

## Business Insights

### Market Positioning

1. Premium Segment (>$15,000):
   - Dominated by diamonds >2 carats
   - Ideal cut and VS2 or higher clarity
   - Represents top 5% of market volume but 20% of revenue

### Price Optimization

1. Sweet Spots:
   - 0.9-1.1 carat range shows optimal price-to-value ratio
   - VS2 clarity with Very Good cut offers best value proposition
   - H color grade provides balance between quality and price

### Inventory Management

1. Stock Distribution:
   - 40% Ideal cut indicates market preference for quality
   - Maintain higher inventory of 0.7-1.2 carat diamonds
